# Image-Based-Hieroglyphic-Character-Recognition
## Overview
**Image-Based Hieroglyphic Character Recognition** is a computer vision project designed to recognize ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic characters from images and translate them into a modern, human-readable language. This project aims to make the fascinating world of hieroglyphs more accessible to historians, linguists, and curious minds alike using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Features

-  Detects and classifies hieroglyphic characters from images
-  Translates recognized characters into a well-known language (English)
-  Uses CNN-based deep learning models for high accuracy
-  Accepts input as photographs of hieroglyphic texts
-  Opens a doorway for digital Egyptology and historical text preservation

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Images are cleaned, resized, and augmented to train the model better.

2. **Model Training**  
   A CNN model is trained to recognize patterns and features in the hieroglyphs.

3. **Prediction**  
   The trained model takes an input image and returns the predicted character and its translated meaning.
